    "text": "Learning to play an instrument is one hell of a challenge. Unlike in the past, there are so many great online resources to choose from. When I started learning, I always felt a bit deserted and didn't really know which resources I could actually trust. Especially in the beginning, it is vital to have access to quality resources and those are often very hard to find. With my play-along covers and detailed tablature I want to make knowledge more accessible.\n\nStarting with drums and later transitioning to guitar, I've gained about 15 years of experience in music. My preferred genre is progressive rock & metal, but I'm also into other kinds of music and love to discover new things about the instruments I'm playing.\n\nI always believed that learning an instrument should be fun and not about all the chit-chat around it. When you choose to invest time in your craft, you should invest that time into something you like. Music theory is inevitable, but it should be an extension to your playing and make more sense of your playing - it should never define your playing."
